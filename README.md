# A project for the _Introduction to Digital Humanities_ @ KU Leuven, 2025
This is a project for the course Introduction to Digital Humanities at KU Leuven in the first semester of the academic year 2025/2026, carried out by Group #5 (Victor Close, Koji Okomura and Petar Soldo).

## A short description of the project

This project is the final exam project for the course [_Introduction to Digital Humanities_](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/G0R03CE), in the [_Advanced Master of Digital Humanities_](https://www.kuleuven.be/programmes/master-digital-humanities) programme at KU Leuven.

The aim of the project is to explore, clean and analyze the data from the _Books divided by Genre from the Digitised 19th century books dataset_ (https://doi.org/10.23636/1140 dataset), hosted by the British Library. 

To this, we use [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) and a number of other tools, to be chosen on the go or in the individual phase of the project.
